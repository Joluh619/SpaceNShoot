SpaceNShoot

this is a game based on the NeoGeo game franchise Metal Slug.

The rules are simple, you have to eliminate the enemy ships in order to get as many points as possible. To get a high score, you also have to avoid being hit by the obstacles that wil come out or the enemy shots as your score progresses.
At the beginning and every time you respawn there will be a moment when you're protected, wich means that you are immune to any kind of enemy contact, but it's just a moment. Also your bullets can make damage in this state!

The game ends when the player´s life counter reaches Zero.
